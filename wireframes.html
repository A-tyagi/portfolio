                        Redesigning the Undergraduate Course Page to Better Fit the Needs of Informatics Students

                    <br>
                    <p>In this project we are presented several sample personas that depict the goals and
                        frustrations of UCI students in the B.S Informatics program. Based on these personas, my
                        task was to generate wireframes to help redesign the undergraduate course page to better
                        fit the needs of Informatics students. I begin by brainstorming three wireframe designs before
                        using student feedback sessions to finalize on one and creating an interactive prototype for the
                        wireframe in Axure.
                        (Personas shown in class cannot be shared)</p>
                    <p>This is the webpage we are tasked with redesigning: <a
                            href="https://www.informatics.uci.edu/undergrad/bs-informatics/">Original B.S
                        Informatics Degree Page</a></p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Wireframe #1</h3>
                    <p>The design for this wireframe focuses on the personas that identified a lack of information
                        regarding the Informatics major as one of their main frustrations. One of the main concerns
                        these personas had was how the Informatics page failed to provide clear descriptions for the
                        different specializations offered and the general skills that students would learn by
                        pursuing it. One persona stated “Uncertain which specialization will help him the most in
                        his desired career path”. In order to mitigate this issue, the wireframe includes 3 panels
                        that provide detailed information regarding each specialization as well as photos related to
                        the general course work. Personas also mentioned that the page was difficult to navigate
                        which made it tough to quickly find information about classes offered and what to expect
                        from the professors teaching them. In order to alleviate these frustrations, the wireframe
                        design includes a scrollable box that lists the course work, description and professors
                        teaching the course. An image set from each course will also be provided in order to provide
                        a better idea of what kind of work will be done in the class. Several personas highlighted
                        that the Informatics as a degree name can be misleading since it sounds like a major that
                        would be data and analytics oriented. I believe that this wireframe helps provide a better
                        overall representation of what the degree covers.</p>
                    <div class="text-center">
                        <img src="images/wireframe1.png" width="800" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Wireframe #2</h3>
                    <p>The design for this wireframe focuses on the personas that identified a lack of career
                        direction and opportunities as their greatest frustration. One persona in specific stated
                        one of their main needs was an ”Introduction to different career and field options to
                        incoming students”. In order to help students discover the different areas of work they can
                        pursue, the wireframe includes a sidebar for exploring different career paths in
                        Informatics. Clicking on a career path button will update the right hand section to a
                        scrollable photo set and detailed description of what jobs and skills students will
                        encounter on that path. Another persona stated “inability to find internships and research
                        opportunities” as one of their struggles. In order to mitigate these issues the design
                        incorporates a section for discovering internship and job/research positions. Clicking on a
                        position from the scrollable list on the left will update the information panel on the right
                        to show a picture, position data and link to the application page.</p>
                    <div class="text-center">
                        <img src="images/wireframe2.png" width="800" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Wireframe #3</h3>
                    <p>This wireframes’ primary focus was on personas that expressed frustrations with UCI not
                        offering enough resources and opportunities to explore the Informatics major and to help
                        form connections. Some personas stated “UCI does not advertise or offer enough opportunities
                        to explore the field” and “lack of clubs and prep sessions for mock interviews”. In an
                        effort to help students discover different skill sets and areas that the degree of
                        Informatics covers, the design includes a section at the bottom to browse through upcoming
                        workshops and events. Clicking on the prev or next buttons will allow the user to cycle
                        through the events and a photo gallery will be included to provide a better idea of what the
                        event will be like. In order to improve the website and help it promote student involvement,
                        the design for the wireframe includes a section for browsing the different Informatics
                        clubs. Clicking on a link will take the user to the club application page. Other personas
                        also expressed a need for “guidance about which informatics courses helped alumni the most
                        during their careers”. To provide students with more confidence in their chosen degree, the
                        wireframe includes a section for users to explore alumni and student profiles where they
                        explain which courses they found most valuable during their time at UCI. Lastly the design
                        incorporates a sidebar layout for the department of informatics page in order to improve
                        usability as many personas complained about the website not being user friendly enough.</p>

                    <div class="text-center">
                        <img src="images/wireframe3.png" width="800" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Interactive Axure Demo</h3>
                    <p> After conducting user feedback and testing sessions with classmates, I chose to implement
                        wireframe #1 because users expressed it best addressed the core issue students had regarding not
                        being able to find enough immediate info
                        about specializations. Even though the first wireframe design lacked interactivity, students
                        tended to find it more practical as many found that extra modals and carousals brought
                        unnecessary clutter. Since this redesign focuses on the degree landing page, I also decided that
                        interactive elements to explore job postings and career paths was best saved for other
                        sections of the website.This redesign includes a simple carousel to explore the three
                        specializations and scrollable section for exploring individual courses offered by UCI.</p>
