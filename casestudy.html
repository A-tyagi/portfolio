                        <h3>The Goal</h3>
                        <p> The focus of this case study was to redesign UConnect, an infotainment and navigation system
                            that is
                            installed in smart cars. The screen replaces a traditional radio, providing services such as
                            music, bluetooth audio, GPS, and many more features all onto one screen. The purpose of it’s
                            design is to allow drivers to easily access the necessary features they desire while on the
                            road, all in one place.
                        </p>
                        <p>Our team's goal was to create a more accessible interface for drivers who need to divide
                            their
                            attention between their infotainment system and the road. It can be difficult to juggle
                            both, especially since the primary focus should be on driving. We aimed to better
                            understand the user base and the product itself through our methods of personas, surveys,
                            interviews, and remote user testing. By collecting and analyzing this data we were able to
                            redesign the UConnect system in a way that promotes better safety and meets the needs of a
                            wider variety of users.</p>

                        <h3>Methods</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Surveys</strong>: Surveys were used to identify and collect preliminary data
                                    about our target
                                    population (e.g. demographic information, pain points, how users are currently
                                    accomplishing tasks). Our survey was designed and administered via Google Survey. It
                                    consisted of a total 16 questions, designed to take approximately 10 minutes to
                                    complete. The team surveyed 31 participants in total. Participants were recruited
                                    within known social groups. Questions focused on five objectives: (1) To find out
                                    the general age distribution, (2) What kind of application and technology
                                    participants used, (3) What they are doing to maintain safety when driving, (4) Main
                                    areas of frustration of interacting with tech/apps while driving, (5) Rating
                                    questions for different scenarios.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Interviews</strong>: Interviews were used with the intention to elicit
                                    information that we
                                    couldn't otherwise get from surveys. Our team conducted a total of eight interviews
                                    with each session taking approximately 30–35 minutes. Each interview consisted of 17
                                    questions, following a semi-structured flow. We asked general as well as open-ended
                                    questions that allow for many opportunities for interviewees to delve deep into
                                    their honest thoughts and criticisms for the product.Interviews followed the
                                    indicated protocol and consent forms were handed and made clear to each interviewee
                                    before beginning. 
                                    In our study, we attempted to learn more about participant's thoughts and opinions
                                    on how they interact with devices and accomplish certain tasks while on the road.
                                    Questions were designed around three main objectives: safety, technology-use and
                                    ability. From this process, we discovered what issues users encountered when using
                                    infotainment systems and how the current interfaces affected their experience.</p>

                                <p><strong>Personas</strong>: Personas represent groups of users with shared qualities
                                    within our target
                                    population. They were used to communicate who the users are and the general focus of
                                    design. Our personas were primarily drawn upon data collected from user interviews,
                                    supplemented by additional data from compiled survey results.
                                    We constructed a total of three personas, each with a general bio, wants & needs,
                                    motivation, key quotes, frustrations and frequently used apps, technological ability
                                    and vehicle usage.</p>

                        <h3>Findings</h3>
                        <p> The findings from the remote user testing sessions and heuristic evaluations proved to be
                            the most useful in helping us identify four high level usability issues that held priority
                            in terms of redesign. These four usability issues included:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Lack of Simplicity</strong>: We found that a majority of the core
                                    functionality was often
                                    crowded by irrelevant and rarely needed features that did not need to be presented
                                    to the user all at once. A clear example of this could be seen during testing
                                    related to the navigation functionality. We saw that participants generally
                                    struggled to figure out where to enter the destination to start the trip and were
                                    unsure of whether to use the search bar on the main page or to use the "Where To?"
                                    button.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Unintuitive and Cluttered Design</strong>: The most flagrant case of
                                    unintuitive design was
                                    identified when more than half of the users struggled to switch the radio to a
                                    specific station. Most users are familiar with turning a dial to tune into a
                                    specific station so participants did not immediately see the tune button within the
                                    cluttered interface. One participant commented after completing the scenario that a
                                    simple task like switching stations should not require opening a separate tuning
                                    page.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Flawed Button Placement</strong>: Another clear usability issue that we
                                    identified from our
                                    results was that a majority of the user errors stemmed from the inconsistent and
                                    poor button placement. During our user testing this was most clear during tasks with
                                    the media player and phone system. For the media page we saw that much of the screen
                                    space was occupied by large non clickable buttons and rarely used functionality,
                                    while the core daily use features were hidden or put to the side. In both scenarios
                                    the participants were led astray by the meaningless button placement of the
                                    interface.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>Scattered Functionality</strong>: Our team found that the last of Uconnect's
                                    usability issues
                                    arose from how important functionality was scattered across the system. During user
                                    testing we saw that all six participants struggled with smoothly transitioning
                                    between tasks since it took time to find the app or feature. We found that more than
                                    half of the participants were surprised to find the radio button hidden away in the
                                    apps page. Most had assumed that radio would be a default button on the navigation
                                    bar.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <h3>My Redesign</h3>
                        <p>As part of the team, my task was to redesign the following navigation system:</p>
                        <div class="text-center">
                            <img src="images/navold.jpeg" width="600" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <p>The navigation screen was redesigned around the goal of improving the simplicity and the
                            general look and feel of the system. The navigation screen suffered from a great deal of
                            clutter and unnecessary functionality that served as a major distraction to drivers.
                            Evidence of this could be seen when users struggled to figure out where to enter a
                            destination during the remote testing sessions. The new design mitigates these issues by
                            improving the screen real estate by condensing more functionality onto a single screen. For
                            example the user can search directly from the search bar at the top. Rather than having to
                            move between several screens, all of the core relevant functionality can be accessed through
                            the expandable buttons to the right. Similarly more of the map is shown to the user since
                            the task bar at the bottom is hidden and can be expanded if the user slides up from the
                            bottom of the screen.</p>
                        <p>Mockups for the redesigned Navigation system. The second image shows the expanded view where
                            the task bar, favorite locations and music can be accessed: </p>

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p id="endpage"> Our team chose Uconnect as our redesign target because we recognize that as
                            cars become more
                            technologically advanced, we're making a move away from tactile buttons and more towards
                            touch displays. With cars having so much smart functionality, if the car infotainment system
                            isn't designed well it can become harder to keep your eyes on the road while trying to
                            switch apps or navigate. It's important that UConnect is designed to be easy to use so that
                            drivers can safely focus on driving rather than fumbling around with badly designed user
                            interfaces.</p>
