                        <h2 class="intro-subtitle">
                            On the surface level of things, Zoom has done a great job at creating a communication tool
                            that can cater to everyone.
                        </h2>

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>With such a large and wide variety of people relying on Zoom, it was no easy task to design a
                            polished user experience that could also satisfy everyone’s functional needs. On the surface
                            level of things, Zoom has done a great job at creating a communication tool that can cater
                            to everyone.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>The Good</h3>
                        <p>The home page of the app has a very clean user interface design that provides clear
                            visibility of functionality and system status. The home page is not cluttered by unnecessary
                            buttons and allows users to easily join and schedule meetings through a set of four buttons.
                            The simple navigation bar at the top allows users to access chat logs, meeting recordings
                            and contacts without unnecessary confusion. Another way that Zoom works to seek universal
                            usability is by providing basic and advanced categories for settings pages that could
                            potentially confuse novice users. This allows the app to cater to all types of users without
                            hindering the advanced users access to important settings and functionality.</p>

                        <p>One way Zoom has worked to improve the user experience of the product outside of the general
                            user interface would be in terms of how Zoom provides users with virtual backgrounds and
                            appearance touch ups. Users are also not put on the spot for having their camera on in Zoom,
                            as the app cycles through participants and only shows those who are currently speaking.
                            Providing such functionality directly improves the user experience because it makes people
                            feel less conscious about their environment and looks. Users are not as confident in
                            interacting online, and giving people quality of life features helps boost their willingness
                            to show themselves and speak on camera.</p>

                        <h3>The Bad</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>Unfortunately, as the certain aspects of Zoom’s functionality gets more intricate, the user
                            experience starts to decline. The first example of this can be seen in regards to how
                            functionality for polling and breakout rooms is split between the website and the desktop
                            client. For example, users have to upload a csv file on the website in order to get the
                            client to remember the predetermined members of each group. Similarly, poll questions and
                            results cannot be easily set and viewed through the client and require using the webpage. To
                            make the matter worse, changing settings through the webpage can be even more confusing as
                            there is no consistency between how the settings page looks like on the standard client.
                            Another example would be how many panels for viewing chat logs and participants have pop out
                            functionality that is hidden in a drop down menu rather than being fluid drag and drop
                            interactions. Similarly, it can be difficult to figure out how to stop sharing certain
                            sections of the screen. The reason this negatively impacts the user experience is because
                            the user can lose track of their cluttered windows and the system provides no way to permit
                            easy reversal of change.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p id="endpage">In summary, I believe it is not easy to label Zoom as just a good or bad example
                            of HCI and
                            user experience. Considering the abnormal amount of load being put on Zoom, I feel they have
                            done a wonderful job of providing the world with a platform to work and collaborate on
                            regardless of location. With that being said however, it seems like Zoom could have paid
                            more attention towards keeping their complex functionality easy to use and learn. All in all
                            I would say that Zoom is still a relatively new product, and that they have a long road
                            ahead of them in terms of perfecting their user experience.</p>
